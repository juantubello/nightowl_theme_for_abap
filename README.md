# night-owl theme for abap 🌌

_This is an attempt to get the night-owl theme in abap, I tried to respect the color scheme, but some adjustments were made to make it look better in the ABAP editor
and fit my personal taste._

## Important 🚀

_To give that unique font look that you can see in the screenshots, you need to install this font, you will not regret it → https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code_

### Install 🔧

Just go to:

 - `%APPDATA%\SAP\SAP GUI\ABAP Editor`
 - Replace the file` abap_spec.xml` with the file u just download
 - Done :)
